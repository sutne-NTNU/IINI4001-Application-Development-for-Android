Use the example from the lecture for inspiration.
* Create a file with titles and authors of several books. Change the example to read from this file and insert it into the database.
* Create a PreferenceScreen where the user can select a background color for the list, add at least three options. Use the ActionBar to navigate to this PreferenceScreen.
* Change the layout so that the user can select to either view all the titles, or all the authors of the books.
