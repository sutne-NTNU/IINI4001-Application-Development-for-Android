# Intro to HTTP
This assignment was meant as an introduction to how you can communicate with an api through the app.
In the assignment we are tasked with communicating with a number-guessing api. The user would enter a name and their card information, and if they manage to guess the correct number in three attempts they will get a "cash reward" deposited to their card. The api will give feedback if the number is too low or too high as well as keep track of the amount of guesses.
