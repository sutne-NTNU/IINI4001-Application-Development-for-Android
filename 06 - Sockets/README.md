# Sockets
This assignment will use sockets to create communication between phones. One will act as a server, receiving two numbers from clients, and then returning the sum of these numbers back. The clients will enter the numbers and get shown the result from the server.

My implementation includes multi-user handling, and a server log that keeps track of the latest tasks performed by the Server.
